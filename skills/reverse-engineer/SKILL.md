When reverse engineering, do the following:

1. **Get a sample of the binary format or code**: Use the appropriate CLI tool for the job, cat may be sufficient for initial inspection if the raw binaty gives some context.
2. **Ask user about what we are trying to achieve**: This will help us understand the context of the binary format or code and what should be the next step.
3. **Use the appropriate CLI tool for the job**: Use the appropriate CLI tool for the job to explore the binary code, decompile the code or map out the binary format of a file.
4. **Ask user for feedback**: Ask user for feedback on the results of the CLI tool and what should be the next step.
5. **Repeat the process**: Repeat the process until the user is satisfied with the results.
